# Weather examples

This repository contains sample Python notebooks that show you what you can do with weather data. You can run these notebooks in a local notebook environment or in the IBM Cloud.

**Notebooks:**

1. [Weather Forecast with matplotlib](https://github.com/MargrietGroenendijk/weather-demos/blob/master/Weather%20Forecast%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynb). Use the Weather Company Data API to get weather forecast json data based on latitude and longitude, convert this json data into a pandas DataFrame and create a weather chart and map with matplotlib.
2. [Weather Forecast PixieApp]().


### Running a notebook locally

The easiest way to install notebooks is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and then type `jupyter notebook` in a Terminal. This will open the notebook environment in a browser. 

### Running a notebook in the IBM Cloud

Another option is to run a notebook in the IBM Cloud. Sign up for a Lite account [here](https://datascience.ibm.com/), which will give you a 2 Spark executors and 5GB of Object Storage for free.
